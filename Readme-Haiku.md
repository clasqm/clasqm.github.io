# Software for the Haiku Operating System

Most of these were written in the [yab](www.yab.orgfree.com) language. I'm not really working on this any more - at least not until Haiku reaches a stable beta status. Apps marked "*beta*" below should compile and run well enough. I am just not ready to call anything a Release until I know the platform they run on will be relatively stable.

**UPDATE**: Haiku has reached beta status, and I am starting to do ground-up rewrites of some of my apps. It will take a while, though. I'm no longer in the repository business, so if you just want the binaries you can download them in hpkg format here on Github or on [Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/u/clasqm/profile).

## Post-beta apps

Existing applications will be rewritten  from the ground up. The idea here is to reduce the reliance on third-party applications where possible and fix some things that I didn't quite get right the first time. The resulting apps will have the same internal name as before (e.g. *Trope* rather than *Trope 2*).
